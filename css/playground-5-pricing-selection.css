   PLAYGROUND 5: PRICING CARD SELECTION
   ===================================================

   Welcome to professional-level interaction design! You've learned
   state selectors, transitions, and coordination. Now you'll architect
   a complete pricing system with multiple interaction states.

   üí≥ THE BUSINESS CHALLENGE:
   These pricing cards need to guide users toward making confident
   purchasing decisions. They should feel trustworthy, highlight the
   best option, and provide clear feedback for every interaction.

   This is REAL e-commerce psychology - the difference between
   users bouncing away confused or converting into customers.

   üéØ LEARNING GOALS:
   - Design complete interaction systems with multiple states
   - Understand visual hierarchy in pricing interfaces
   - Master complex hover, focus, and selection feedback
   - Apply transition techniques to business-critical interfaces

   üìù YOUR MISSION:
   Create a pricing section that professional SaaS companies would
   be proud to use on their websites!

   ================================================= */

/* STEP 1: Understanding Pricing Psychology
   ========================================

   üîç OBSERVE: Look at the pricing cards in your browser.

   Current problems:
   - All cards look equally important (no hierarchy)
   - No clear feedback when hovering or focusing
   - Featured plan doesn't stand out enough
   - Buttons feel disconnected from the card experience

   Professional pricing pages solve this with:
   - Clear visual hierarchy (featured plan stands out)
   - Smooth hover feedback (cards feel interactive)
   - Strong call-to-action buttons (build purchase confidence)
   - Coordinated transitions (everything feels connected)
*/

/* STEP 2: Base Card Structure
   ===========================

   Each pricing card needs to work as a cohesive unit where every
   element coordinates to guide the user toward a decision.
*/

.pricing-card {
  /* Layout and spacing */
  background: white;
  border: 2px solid #e2e8f0;
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 2rem;
  margin: 1rem;
  max-width: 280px;
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;

  /* Subtle base shadow */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);

  /* TODO #1: Add your base transition

     We'll be animating multiple properties across the entire card:
     - transform (for elevation and subtle scaling)
     - box-shadow (for depth changes)
     - border-color (for selection feedback)

     Add this comprehensive transition:
     transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease, border-color 0.3s ease;
  */
}

/* STEP 3: Featured Plan Hierarchy
   ===============================

   The "Pro" plan should immediately stand out as the recommended option.
   This is visual hierarchy - guiding user attention to the best choice.
*/

.pricing-card.featured {
  /* Make it more prominent */
  border-color: #74b9ff;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(116, 185, 255, 0.15);

  /* TODO #2: Make the featured card slightly larger

     Add this to make the Pro plan more prominent:
     transform: scale(1.05);

     This subtle scaling makes it feel more important without being dramatic.
  */
}

.plan-badge {
  /* Position the "Most Popular" badge */
  position: absolute;
  top: -12px;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);

  /* Badge styling */
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #74b9ff, #0984e3);
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 20px;
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  letter-spacing: 0.5px;
  text-transform: uppercase;

  /* Subtle shadow */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(116, 185, 255, 0.3);
}

/* STEP 4: Typography and Content Hierarchy
   ========================================

   Clear typography hierarchy helps users quickly scan and compare options.
*/

.plan-header h3 {
  color: #2c3e50;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  font-weight: 700;
}

.price {
  font-size: 3rem;
  font-weight: 800;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
  line-height: 1;
}

.price span {
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: #64748b;
}

.features {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 1.5rem 0;
  text-align: left;
}

.features li {
  padding: 0.5rem 0;
  color: #4a5568;
  position: relative;
  padding-left: 1.5rem;
}

.features li::before {
  content: "‚úì";
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  color: #27ae60;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* STEP 5: The Hover Challenge - Card Elevation
   ============================================

   üéØ GOAL: When users hover over any pricing card, it should feel
   elevated and interactive - like they're considering this option.

   üí° TECHNIQUE HINTS:
   - Use transform: translateY() for subtle lifting
   - Increase box-shadow for more dramatic elevation
   - Consider highlighting the border for selection feedback
   - Keep the featured card special even when others are hovered

   üîß YOUR ARCHITECTURAL TASK: Design the complete hover experience!
*/

.pricing-card:hover {
  /* TODO #3: Add elevation movement

     Make the card lift toward the user when hovered.
     Try: transform: translateY(-8px);

     For the featured card, combine with its existing scale:
     You might need: transform: translateY(-8px) scale(1.05);
  */

  /* TODO #4: Add elevated shadow

     Create a more dramatic shadow for the elevated state.
     Try: box-shadow: 0 12px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);

     This makes the card feel like it's floating higher above the page.
  */

  /* TODO #5: Add selection border hint

     Give a subtle hint that this card is being considered.
     Try: border-color: #74b9ff;

     This creates a gentle selection preview.
  */
}

/* STEP 6: Featured Card Special Hover State
   =========================================

   The featured card should maintain its prominence while still responding to hover.
*/

.pricing-card.featured:hover {
  /* TODO #6: Enhanced featured card hover

     The featured card needs special treatment. It should:
     - Lift up like other cards: translateY(-8px)
     - Maintain its scale: scale(1.05)
     - Get an even more dramatic shadow

     Try: transform: translateY(-8px) scale(1.05);
     And: box-shadow: 0 16px 32px rgba(116, 185, 255, 0.2);
  */
}

/* STEP 7: Button Integration
   ==========================

   The buttons should feel connected to the card experience, not separate.
*/

.select-plan {
  /* Button styling */
  width: 100%;
  padding: 1rem;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 8px;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-top: 1.5rem;

  /* Default button appearance */
  background: #f8f9fa;
  color: #495057;

  /* TODO #7: Add button transition

     Buttons need their own smooth transitions:
     transition: all 0.2s ease;

     Slightly faster than the card transitions for responsiveness.
  */
}

/* Featured plan gets a special button */
.featured .select-plan {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #74b9ff, #0984e3);
  color: white;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(116, 185, 255, 0.3);
}

.select-plan:hover {
  /* TODO #8: Design button hover states

     Regular buttons on hover:
     - background: #e9ecef;
     - transform: translateY(-2px);

     Featured button on hover:
     - background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0984e3, #74b9ff);
     - transform: translateY(-2px);
     - box-shadow: 0 6px 12px rgba(116, 185, 255, 0.4);
  */
}

.select-plan:active {
  /* TODO #9: Add pressed states

     When buttons are clicked, they should feel pressed:
     transform: translateY(0px);

     This gives satisfying feedback for the click action.
  */
}

/* STEP 8: Focus States for Accessibility
   ======================================

   Keyboard users should get the same great experience as mouse users.
*/

.pricing-card:focus-within {
  /* TODO #10: Add focus state for accessibility

     When a card or its button has focus (Tab navigation):
     - Copy your hover transform and shadow effects
     - Add: outline: 3px solid #74b9ff; outline-offset: 2px;

     This ensures keyboard users get visual feedback too.
  */
}

/* STEP 9: Experience the Complete System!
   =======================================

   üéâ INTEGRATION TIME: Complete TODOs #1-10:
   1. Add comprehensive transitions to the base card
   2. Make the featured card stand out with scaling
   3. Create elevation effects on hover
   4. Design button interactions
   5. Add accessibility focus states
   6. Save and test!

   üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST:
   - Hover over each card - do they feel interactive?
   - Tab through with keyboard - are focus states clear?
   - Click buttons - do they feel responsive?
   - Does the Pro plan feel like the obvious choice?
   - Do all interactions feel smooth and coordinated?
*/

/* EXPERIMENT ZONE! üß™
   ====================

   Now that you have a complete pricing system, try these refinements:

   TODO #11: Different elevation levels for different plans
   Give each plan type a different hover elevation:

   .basic-plan:hover { transform: translateY(-6px); }
   .pro-plan:hover { transform: translateY(-10px) scale(1.05); }
   .enterprise-plan:hover { transform: translateY(-8px); }

   This creates subtle hierarchy even in hover states!

   TODO #12: Color-coded hover effects

   Green:
   .basic-plan:hover { border-color: #27ae60; }
   Blue:
   .pro-plan:hover { border-color: #74b9ff; }
   Purple:
   .enterprise-plan:hover { border-color: #8e44ad; }

   TODO #13: Staggered card appearances (Advanced)
   Make cards fade in with different delays when the page loads:

   .pricing-card { opacity: 0; animation: fadeInUp 0.6s ease forwards; }
   .basic-plan { animation-delay: 0.1s; }
   .pro-plan { animation-delay: 0.2s; }
   .enterprise-plan { animation-delay: 0.3s; }

   @keyframes fadeInUp {
     from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(30px); }
     to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
   }

   TODO #14: Plan comparison highlighting
   When hovering one card, slightly fade the others:

   .pricing-card:not(:hover) { opacity: 0.7; }

   This helps users focus on one option at a time!
*/

/* STEP 10: Real-World Pricing Psychology
   ======================================

   Your pricing interface now uses professional conversion techniques:

   üí∞ ANCHORING: The enterprise plan makes Pro feel reasonable
   üéØ SOCIAL PROOF: "Most Popular" badge guides toward Pro
   üìä VISUAL HIERARCHY: Featured card stands out immediately
   ‚ö° INTERACTION FEEDBACK: Smooth responses build trust
   üé® ELEVATION METAPHOR: Cards feel "lifted" when considered

   These exact patterns are used by:
   - Stripe (payment processing)
   - Slack (team communication)
   - Figma (design tools)
   - Netflix (subscription tiers)
   - GitHub (developer plans)
*/

/* STEP 11: A/B Testing Considerations
   ===================================

   In real projects, you'd test variations of:

   üîç FEATURED CARD SCALING:
   - No scaling vs. 1.05 vs. 1.1
   - Which converts better?

   ‚è±Ô∏è TRANSITION TIMING:
   - Fast (0.2s) vs. Medium (0.3s) vs. Slow (0.5s)
   - Which feels more trustworthy?

   üé® HOVER ELEVATION:
   - Subtle (-4px) vs. Medium (-8px) vs. Dramatic (-12px)
   - Which increases engagement?

   üéØ BUTTON STYLES:
   - Solid vs. Gradient vs. Outline
   - Which drives more clicks?
*/

/* DEBUGGING SECTION üîß
   =====================

   Common pricing interface issues:

   ‚ùå "My featured card doesn't stand out!"
   ‚úÖ Check: Are you using both border-color and box-shadow?
      Is the scale transform applied to .featured?

   ‚ùå "Hover effects feel inconsistent!"
   ‚úÖ Ensure: All cards use the same transition timing and properties

   ‚ùå "The buttons don't feel connected to the cards!"
   ‚úÖ Try: Faster button transitions (0.2s) and coordinated colors

   ‚ùå "Focus states are hard to see!"
   ‚úÖ Check: Is the outline color contrasting enough?
      Try stronger colors like #0984e3

   ‚ùå "The whole thing feels overwhelming!"
   ‚úÖ Reduce: Animation durations and elevation distances
      Sometimes less is more

   üéâ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
   - Pro plan clearly feels like the recommended choice
   - All interactions feel smooth and coordinated
   - Cards feel interactive and trustworthy
   - Buttons feel confident and clickable
   - Keyboard navigation works perfectly
