/* ===================================================
   PLAYGROUND 2: FORM INPUT HIGHLIGHTS  
   ===================================================
   
   Building on your button knowledge, you'll now learn how 
   transitions make forms feel helpful and accessible.
   
   Right now, these form inputs provide no feedback when 
   users interact with them. This makes forms feel cold 
   and unresponsive.
   
   Professional websites guide users through forms with 
   gentle visual cues. You're about to master this essential 
   user experience pattern!
   
   üéØ LEARNING GOALS:
   - Master the :focus state for accessibility
   - Learn form-specific transition patterns
   - Understand visual hierarchy in user interfaces
   - Build confidence with border and color transitions
   
   üìù INSTRUCTIONS:
   Click into each form field and Tab between them as you 
   work through the TODOs. Watch how the experience improves!
   
   ================================================= */

/* STEP 1: Understanding Form Accessibility
   ========================================
   
   Forms are where users accomplish goals: signing up, 
   contacting you, making purchases. Poor form design 
   loses customers and frustrates users.
   
   Good form design provides:
   - Clear focus indication (which field is active)
   - Smooth transitions between states
   - Visual hierarchy (important fields stand out)
   - Accessibility for keyboard users
   
   üîç CURRENT STATE: Click into the form fields in your browser.
   Notice: There's barely any feedback! Users can't tell 
   which field is active or how to navigate effectively.
*/

/* Basic form structure styling */
.highlight-form {
  max-width: 400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.form-group {
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

.form-group label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #2c3e50;
  font-size: 14px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.5px;
}

/* STEP 2: Base Input Styling
   ==========================
   
   First, let's style the inputs to look clean and professional.
   Notice we're not adding the transition YET - we want you to 
   experience the jarring instant changes first!
*/

.form-input {
  /* Size and spacing */
  width: 100%;
  padding: 12px 16px;
  font-size: 16px;

  /* Visual appearance */
  border: 2px solid #e2e8f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-color: #ffffff;

  /* Remove default browser styling */
  outline: none;
  box-sizing: border-box;

  /* Font styling */
  font-family: inherit;
  color: #2c3e50;

  /* We'll add transitions here soon! */
}

/* STEP 3: The :focus State (Accessibility Essential!)
   ===================================================
   
   The :focus state activates when:
   - User clicks into an input field
   - User tabs to an input field with keyboard
   - User touches an input field on mobile
   
   This state is REQUIRED for accessibility. Users who navigate 
   with keyboards (screen readers, motor disabilities, power users) 
   depend on clear focus indication.
   
   üåü PRO TIP: Many websites fail accessibility because they 
   remove focus styles. Don't be one of them!
*/

.form-input:focus {
  /* TODO #1: Uncomment this line to add a focus border color */
  /* border-color: #74b9ff; */

  /* TODO #2: Uncomment this line to add a subtle background change */
  /* background-color: #f8f9ff; */

  /* TODO #3: Uncomment this line for a gentle glow effect */
  /* box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(116, 185, 255, 0.1); */
}

/* STEP 4: Experience the Jarring Changes
   ======================================
   
   üîç EXPERIMENT: Uncomment TODO #1, #2, and #3 above.
   Save and test by clicking into different form fields.
   
   Notice how the changes feel INSTANT and HARSH? 
   Just like with the button, this doesn't feel polished.
   
   ‚è∞ SPEND 2 MINUTES: Tab through the form fields with your 
   keyboard. The jarring changes make it hard to focus on 
   the content you're trying to input.
   
   Professional forms feel SMOOTH and HELPFUL.
*/

/* STEP 5: Adding the Transition Magic
   ===================================
   
   Just like with buttons, we'll add a transition to the BASE 
   element (not the :focus state) so the animation works both 
   entering AND leaving focus.
*/

/* TODO #4: Add smooth transitions to all form inputs
   
   Add this line to the .form-input rule above (after the color line):
   
   transition: all 0.3s ease;
   
   This will smoothly animate:
   - Border color changes
   - Background color changes  
   - Box shadow appearance/disappearance
*/

/* STEP 6: Feel the Difference!
   =============================
   
   üéâ TRANSFORMATION TIME: After adding the transition:
   1. Save your file
   2. Refresh browser
   3. Click between form fields
   4. Use Tab key to navigate
   
   Amazing difference, right? The form now feels:
   - Responsive and alive
   - Gentle and welcoming
   - Professional and polished
   - Accessible and clear
   
   This is the difference between amateur and professional forms!
*/

/* STEP 7: Understanding Form States
   =================================
   
   Forms can have several important states beyond :focus:
   
   :focus = field is currently active
   :hover = mouse is over the field  
   :valid = field contains valid data
   :invalid = field contains invalid data
   :disabled = field is not interactive
   
   Let's add a subtle hover state for better user experience.
*/

.form-input:hover {
  /* TODO #5: Add a subtle hover effect */
  /* Uncomment this line for a gentle border color hint */
  /* border-color: #cbd5e0; */
}

/* STEP 8: Textarea Special Considerations
   =======================================
   
   Textareas need special attention because:
   - They're larger and more prominent
   - Users resize them (or browsers do automatically)
   - They often contain longer content
   
   The resize property controls whether users can drag the corner 
   to make the textarea bigger.
*/

textarea.form-input {
  /* TODO #6: Uncomment this line to prevent awkward resizing */
  /* resize: vertical; */

  /* Textareas need a bit more height */
  min-height: 100px;
}

/* STEP 9: Advanced Focus Effects (Optional Challenge)
   ===================================================
   
   Want to get fancy? Try these advanced focus effects:
*/

/* TODO #7: Animated label movement (advanced)
   
   This is a popular pattern where labels "float" up when 
   the field is focused. It's complex but beautiful!
   
   For now, just observe this pattern on sites like:
   - Material Design forms (Google)  
   - Modern banking websites
   - SaaS application forms
   
   We'll learn how to build this in future labs!
*/

/* EXPERIMENT ZONE! üß™  
   ====================
   
   Try these experiments to deepen your understanding:
   
   TODO #8: Different transition timing
   Replace your transition with:
   - transition: all 0.1s ease;    (snappy)
   - transition: all 0.6s ease;    (slow)
   - transition: all 0.3s linear;  (constant speed)
   
   Which feels best for form inputs?
   
   TODO #9: Specific property transitions
   Try animating just certain properties:
   - transition: border-color 0.3s ease;
   - transition: box-shadow 0.2s ease-out;
   - transition: background-color 0.4s ease;
   
   TODO #10: Different focus colors
   Try different border colors in your :focus state:
   - border-color: #00b894; (green - success feeling)
   - border-color: #fd79a8; (pink - friendly feeling)
   - border-color: #fdcb6e; (yellow - warm feeling)
   
   How do different colors change the emotional feel?
   
   TODO #11: Enhanced glow effects
   Try different box-shadow values:
   - box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(116, 185, 255, 0.2);
   - box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(116, 185, 255, 0.15);
   - box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2px #74b9ff;
   
   Each creates a different style of focus indication!
*/

/* STEP 10: Real-World Form Patterns 
   =================================
   
   Professional websites use these exact techniques:
   
   üè¶ BANKING FORMS: Strong focus states for security confidence
   - Clear borders, obvious active states
   - Often blue (trustworthy) or green (secure) colors
   
   üõí E-COMMERCE CHECKOUT: Smooth, non-distracting transitions  
   - Gentle changes that don't interrupt thinking
   - Success colors for completed fields
   
   üì± MOBILE APPS: Larger touch targets with obvious feedback
   - Bigger glow effects for finger navigation
   - Faster transitions for responsive feel
   
   üíº B2B SOFTWARE: Accessible, keyboard-friendly navigation
   - Strong focus indicators for power users
   - Consistent timing across the entire application
*/

/* STEP 11: Accessibility Deep Dive 
   ================================
   
   These transitions aren't just pretty - they're functional:
   
   ‚ôø SCREEN READERS: Clear focus states help users understand 
   where they are in the form
   
   ‚å®Ô∏è KEYBOARD USERS: Smooth transitions make Tab navigation 
   feel natural instead of jarring
   
   üéØ FOCUS MANAGEMENT: Visual feedback helps users stay oriented 
   in complex forms
   
   üß† COGNITIVE LOAD: Smooth changes reduce mental effort needed 
   to track form state
   
   Remember: Accessibility benefits EVERYONE, not just users 
   with disabilities!
*/

/* DEBUGGING SECTION üîß
   =====================
   
   Common form transition issues:
   
   ‚ùå "My focus state doesn't show!"
   ‚úÖ Check: Did you remove "outline: none" without adding 
      a replacement focus indicator?
   
   ‚ùå "Transitions feel laggy on mobile!"
   ‚úÖ Try: Shorter durations (0.2s) and avoid complex shadows
   
   ‚ùå "The glow effect looks weird!"
   ‚úÖ Check: Are you using rgba() colors with low opacity?
      Try rgba(116, 185, 255, 0.1) instead of solid colors
   
   ‚ùå "Users can't tell which field is active!"
   ‚úÖ Ensure: Strong enough contrast between normal and focus states
   
   üéâ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
   - Clear visual difference between normal and focused states
   - Smooth transitions when tabbing through fields
   - Professional, non-distracting visual feedback
   - Works well with both mouse and keyboard navigation
*/

/* STEP 12: Performance and Best Practices üí°
   ===========================================
   
   PERFORMANCE: Border and background transitions are efficient.
   Box-shadow transitions are slightly more expensive but usually fine.
   
   TIMING: Forms should feel responsive but not rushed.
   0.2s-0.4s is ideal for form elements.
   
   CONSISTENCY: Use the same transition timing for all form 
   elements on your site.
   
   CONTRAST: Ensure focus states meet accessibility contrast 
   requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
   
   TESTING: Always test with keyboard navigation (Tab key) 
   and consider users who navigate without a mouse.
